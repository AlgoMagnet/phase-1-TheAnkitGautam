# Importance of hexadecimal:-

According to me hexadecimal can represent very large number in very less space or least number of digits.


As per from some websites:-
## a) Research gate :-

Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers because they provide a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble (or nybble), which is 1/2 of a byte. For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, which can be conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.

## b) Worldsupporter :-

Hexadecimal numbers are also used to enhance the security of a website. Many developers convert the decimal number to hexadecimal and then save that number to the database. And when they want to retrieve that number, they convert hexadecimal to decimal and then show it to the users. This translation is useful for embedded systems because decimal numbers are used in the embedded systems heavily. 

## c) Medium :-

With 2 hexadecimal digits, we can express any number from 0 to 255. To do the same in binary, we need 8 digits.
